createPopulation.out creates population files like in the three example files given. It generates people of the given population number and 
randomly generates which of them are infected at first, and also provides the visit patterns for each person.
spreader.out takes in a population file as an argument and generates the number of days it takes for everyone to be infected.
Note: vector.cpp/h and BinaryHeap.cpp/h are modified versions of Weiss' files.
